# Overview of project

Our project, takes images using the camera every predefined seconds, feeds it into a cloud bucket and performs image recognition on it. It has been preconfigured to identify faces and highlight them. Currently it is performing the function of security camera, thus when it recognises a person, it will email the owner and issue a verbal warning to the visitor.It has been attached to servos to allow movement of the camera however this application is infinitely dynamic, allowing it to be used for a variety of other purposes such as as being able to be configured for Optical character recognition and other artificial intelligence purposes.

## Installation

To implement the google cloud functions, the libraries need to be installed on the Raspberry Pi. 
Install Google Cloud Storage (https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-storage/)

```bash
sudo pip install google-cloud-storage
```
Install Google Cloud Vision (https://pypi.org/project/google-cloud-vision/)
```bash
sudo  install google-cloud-vision
```

Install Pillow (https://pypi.org/project/Pillow/2.2.1)
```bash
sudo  pip install Pillow
```
To implement MySQL database, the MySQL libraries need to be installed. If you are using the ST0324 IoT Raspbian image, you might encounter an error as the libraries have already been pre-installed. If you are using a fresh image, you would need to run the commands below to install the MySQL libraries.

```bash
sudo pip install mysql-connector-python
sudo pip install mysql-connector
```
Finally, install the pubsub libararies needed to send mqtt data

```bash
sudo pip install google-cloud-pubsub
```
